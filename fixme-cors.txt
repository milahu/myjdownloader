having two different hosts for jdownloader API (localhost:3128) and webinterface (localhost:8000)
is causing "blocked by CORS policy" errors

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:3128/my/listdevices?sessiontoken=?&rid=1726341199667&signature=94b39b9e940bc6230f9cb9fdc447d2ba9c3ac5e5175383fef2ac2cd4fa6e8896' from origin 'http://localhost:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.



possible solutions

use some http server (lighttpd?) as reverse proxy for jdownloader at localhost:3128
this solution requires no change to jdownloader, but requires running an extra http server

add an extension to jdownloader to add more request handlers to the http server at localhost:3128
this solution requires no change to jdownloader core

modify jdownloader core to add more request handlers to the http server at localhost:3128



currently http://localhost:3128/ returns

{
 "src"  : "DEVICE",
 "data" : null,
 "type" : "API_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND"
}

but it should return the webinterface at my.jdownloader.org/index.html



TODO also implement these API routes

POST /my/listdevices?sessiontoken=?&rid=1726387623574&signature=c137fc073a2bfdb61fce12626d327f4e07cf2dd7504399b41867d1ffc2f3ccb2

POST /my/feedback?sessiontoken=?&rid=1726387633502&signature=5120ed0db04e006e96470e1c6c96d139c094d8afc99d6cafcbdb023d4c0a48bb
