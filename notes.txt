My.JDownloader API Documentation
Pro Tip: It's possible to access the JDownloader API directly (Bypass our server)
by enabling the so called 'Deprecated API' in the Advanced Options.

https://board.jdownloader.org/showthread.php?p=420311#post420311
MyJDownloader and the browser extension provides so called direct connection mode.
In this mode the traffic is direct between client and your JDownloader.
Only session handling, event notification still happens through our server.

My jdownloader own server
You can create you own client applications and if you wish also your own server.
Client is available as open source.
Protocol/API is open source as well.
Server is closed source, so you will have to develop it yourself.

JDownloader headless self-hosted web-client that is not MyJDownloader?
I'd love to have a more autonomous, independent setup and replace MyJDownloader with some self-hosted solution.

https://support.jdownloader.org/en/knowledgebase/article/updates-update-behavior
Updates to non-plugin components require a "Core update".
When Core update is released, default behaviour is for the client to pre-download,
and indicate via flashing update button that an update is available to install.
If you don't use any of these notifications, update will install on exit/close of application.
JDownloader restart is required for core components to become available.
Core updates can at times take many days to weeks to be released publicly, due to development schedule and testing.
We do not provide ETA for Core updates to be released, you will need to wait!
